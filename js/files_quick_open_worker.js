/*
 * files_quick_open_worker.js - the worker-side half of the Files quick open
 * feature. Embedded at the head of upstream's file-index worker bundle
 * (.vite/build/file-index-worker/fileIndexWorker.js) by
 * patches/community/add_feature_files_quick_open_worker.nim, which also rewrites
 * the ONE call site `this.index.search(query, limit)` inside
 * FileIndexHost.search to `__cdbQoSearch(this.index, query, limit)`.
 *
 * WHY: upstream's scorer walks the query character by character with indexOf,
 * so whitespace in the query has to occur literally in the path - "user
 * service" returns nothing while "user-service" finds user-service.spec.ts.
 * VS Code (src/vs/base/common/fuzzyScorer.ts) splits the query on spaces into
 * pieces, requires EVERY piece to match (doScoreItemFuzzyMultiple returns
 * NO_ITEM_SCORE otherwise), sums the piece scores and merges the match ranges.
 * This helper ports exactly that on top of upstream's unchanged scorer - the
 * MEMBERSHIP from upstream's own per-piece scans, the ORDER from a VS Code-style
 * label-first score (__cdbQoScorePath below), because upstream only hands us an
 * ordinal rank per piece and a sum of ordinals ranks directories above files.
 *
 * CONTRACT of `index` (upstream's scorer instance, class T in the worker):
 *   index.readyCount           number of indexed paths (0 while building)
 *   index.search(query, limit) -> [{ path, score: rank/n, positions: number[] }]
 *                                 best first, at most `limit`
 *
 * GATE: process.env.CDB_FILES_QUICK_OPEN === "1". The main process mirrors the
 * `filesQuickOpen` pref into that variable (js/files_quick_open_main.js) and
 * Electron's utilityProcess.fork() passes main's env through unchanged, so a
 * worker forked after the pref changed sees the new value. Off / unset means the
 * query reaches upstream's scorer verbatim - a full retreat to stock behaviour.
 *
 * Utility-process module scope: a top-level function declaration here is
 * visible to the rest of the bundle because the patch splices this file into
 * the same module. Every name here carries the __cdbQo prefix so nothing in
 * upstream's own module scope can be shadowed.
