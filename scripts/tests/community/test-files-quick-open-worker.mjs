/*
 * test-files-quick-open-worker.mjs - the worker-side helper of the Files quick
 * open feature (js/files_quick_open_worker.js, delivered into upstream's
 * .vite/build/file-index-worker/fileIndexWorker.js by
 * patches/community/add_feature_files_quick_open_worker.nim).
 *
 * Upstream's scorer walks the query char by char with indexOf, so a SPACE has to
 * literally occur in the path: "user service" returned nothing (measured live
 * 2026-08-29 on 1.37937.3). VS Code splits the query on spaces into pieces that
 * must ALL match (fuzzyScorer.ts prepareQuery / doScoreItemFuzzyMultiple). The
 * helper ports that on top of upstream's index without touching its scorer.
 *
 * Part A runs the helper against a FAKE index that reproduces upstream's
 * contract: search(query, limit) -> [{path, score: rank/n, positions}], greedy
 * subsequence, sorted best-first. Part B, when a compiled patch binary and an
 * extracted worker bundle exist locally, patches a copy of the REAL worker and
 * require()s it. Part B is reported as SKIP when either is missing.
 *
 * PART B SKIPS IN CI BY DESIGN. CI runs this harness from a clean checkout with
 * no extracted bundle under tmp/ (the .deb is only unpacked inside the build
 * job's own workspace), so there is nothing to patch and the block prints
 * "SKIP real worker". That is not a coverage hole: in CI the guard against an
 * upstream re-minify is the patch itself, which runs in the build and fails the
 * whole job unless BOTH of its preconditions hold - the FileIndexHost.search
 * call-site anchor (exactly one hit) and the scorer still destructuring
 * `readyCount` off `this` (which the helper's full-set scan depends on; without
 * it multi-piece queries would silently return nothing). Part B is the LOCAL
 * end-to-end check: run it on a dev box with an extract under tmp/ (see
 * ./scripts/build-local.sh) after any change to the helper or the patch.
